Whenever you want to use ant thread safe version of ant collection object,take help of java.util.concurrent.* package. It has almost all concurrent version of unsynchronized collection objects. eg: for ArrayList, you have java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList

You can do Collections.synchronizedCollection(any collection object),but remember this classical synchr. technique is expensive and comes with performence overhead. java.util.concurrent.* package is less expensive and manage the performance in better way by using mechanisms like

copy-on-write,compare-and-swap,Lock,snapshot iterators,etc.
